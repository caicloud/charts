      Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, 
      used as a database, cache and message broker. 
      It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, 
      sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. 
      Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and 
      different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and 
      automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
